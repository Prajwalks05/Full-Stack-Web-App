 'Digital Electronics: Principles, Devices and Applications is a comprehensive book covering, in
 one volume, both the fundamentals of digital electronics and the applications of digital devices and
 integrated circuits. It is different from similar books on the subject in more than one way. Each chapter
 in the book, whether it is related to operational fundamentals or applications, is amply illustrated
 with diagrams and design examples. In addition, the book covers several new topics, which are of
 relevance to any one having an interest in digital electronics and not covered in the books already in
 print on the subject. These include digital troubleshooting, digital 
 instrumentation, programmable logic
 devices, microprocessors and microcontrollers. While the book covers in entirety what is required by
 undergraduate and graduate level students of engineering in electrical, 
  electronics, computer science and
 information technology disciplines, it is intended to be a very useful reference book for professionals,
 R&D scientists and students at post graduate level',

 'Developers and architects who have prior experience in any web app stack other than  the MERN stack will find this book useful for learning about this modern stack. Prior knowledge of how web applications work is required. Knowledge of JavaScript is also required. It is further assumed that the reader knows the basics of HTML and CSS. It will greatly help if you are also familiar with the version control tool git; you can try out the code just by cloning the git repository that holds all the source code described in this book, and running each step by just checking out a branch.If you have decided that your new app will use the MERN stack, then this book will help you quickly get off the ground. Even if you have not made any decision, reading the book will get you excited about MERN and equip you with enough knowledge to make that decision for a future project. The most important thing you will learn is how to put  together multiple technologies and build a complete, functional web application; by the book’s end, you’ll be a full-stack developer or architect on MERN',

The nature and character of British imperialism, its impact on the social, economic and administrative life of India, and the Indian response have also been dealt with in detail. Finally, the strengthening of the idea of nationhood in the country and the development of a countrywide struggle against foreign rule, culmi- nating in the attainment of independence, is studied.
